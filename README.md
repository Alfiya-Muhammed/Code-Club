### Project Description
[2-3 lines about what your project does]
### Traffic Light Simulator Project
This project simulates traffic light operations with features for pedestrians and emergency vehicle overrides. It uses a Node.js backend with SQLite for data storage and Express.js for APIs. Static pages (HTML/CSS/JS) manage the simulator and emergency reporting. To run, clone the repo, install dependencies (`npm install`), and start the server (`node server.js`). Access the simulator at `http://localhost:3001`.

### The Problem statement
[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
The Traffic Light Simulator Project simulates real-time traffic light operations, incorporating pedestrian requests and emergency vehicle overrides, with a Node.js backend, SQLite storage, and a web interface for interaction.

### The Solution
[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
The Traffic Light Simulator simulates traffic light operations, allowing for pedestrian and emergency vehicle overrides, using a Node.js backend, SQLite for data storage, and a web interface for user interaction.
